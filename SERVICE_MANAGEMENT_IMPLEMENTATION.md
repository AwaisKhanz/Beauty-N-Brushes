## Backend Integration

### Existing API Endpoints Used:

```typescript
GET / api / v1 / services; // Get all provider services
POST / api / v1 / services; // Create new service
POST / api / v1 / ai / generate - service - description; // AI description generation
```

### Service Data Flow:

1. **Service Creation:**

   ```
   Frontend Form → Validation → API Call → Create Service in DB → Return Service Object
   ```

2. **Service List:**

   ```
   Page Load → Fetch Services → Display with Real Data → Enable Search/Filter
   ```

3. **AI Description:**
   ```
   Title + Category → API Call → OpenAI GPT-4 → Generated Description → Set in Form
   ```

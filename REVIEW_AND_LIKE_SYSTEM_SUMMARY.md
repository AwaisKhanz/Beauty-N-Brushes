# Review & Like System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive review and rating system with photo attachments, review helpfulness tracking, and likes for both provider profiles and services. All features track user actions for proper UI states and prevent duplicates.

## Database Changes

### New Tables Created

1. **ReviewMedia** - Photos/videos attached to reviews
   - Fields: id, reviewId, mediaType, fileUrl, thumbnailUrl, displayOrder, createdAt
   - Indexes: reviewId

2. **ReviewHelpful** - Track who marked reviews as helpful
   - Fields: id, reviewId, userId, createdAt
   - Unique constraint: (reviewId, userId)
   - Indexes: reviewId, userId

3. **ProviderLike** - Track who liked provider profiles
   - Fields: id, providerId, userId, createdAt
   - Unique constraint: (providerId, userId)
   - Indexes: providerId, userId

4. **ServiceLike** - Track who liked services
   - Fields: id, serviceId, userId, createdAt
   - Unique constraint: (serviceId, userId)
   - Indexes: serviceId, userId

### Updated Tables

- **Review**: Added `reviewMedia` and `helpfulMarks` relations
- **ProviderProfile**: Added `likeCount` field and `likes` relation
- **Service**: Renamed `favoriteCount` to `likeCount`, added `likes` relation

### Migration Applied

- File: `backend/prisma/migrations/20251020_add_reviews_and_likes_system.sql`
- Status: ✅ Successfully applied

## Key Features

### Review System

✅ **Booking-based reviews** - Only for completed bookings, one review per booking
✅ **Multiple ratings** - Overall, quality, timeliness, professionalism (1-5 stars)
✅ **Photo attachments** - Up to 5 photos per review with thumbnails
✅ **Provider responses** - Providers can respond to reviews
✅ **Helpful marking** - Users can mark reviews as helpful (tracked per user)
✅ **Rating calculations** - Automatic provider rating & distribution updates
✅ **Visibility control** - Reviews can be hidden, featured, or verified
✅ **Pagination** - All list endpoints support pagination

### Like System

✅ **Provider likes** - Track who liked each provider profile
✅ **Service likes** - Track who liked each service
✅ **Atomic counts** - Like counts increment/decrement atomically in transactions
✅ **Duplicate prevention** - Unique constraints prevent duplicate likes
✅ **Like status** - Check if current user liked something
✅ **User's likes** - Get all items a user has liked (combined & sorted)

### Security & Validation

✅ **Ownership verification** - Users can only edit/delete their own reviews
✅ **Booking validation** - Only completed bookings can be reviewed
✅ **Provider validation** - Only providers can respond to reviews
✅ **Rating validation** - All ratings must be between 1-5
✅ **Duplicate prevention** - Cannot review same booking twice

### Performance Optimizations

✅ **Indexed queries** - All foreign keys and common query fields indexed
✅ **Paginated results** - All list endpoints support pagination
✅ **Selective includes** - Only fetch necessary relations
✅ **Atomic operations** - Use transactions for count updates
✅ **Async rating updates** - Provider ratings updated asynchronously

### Type Safety

✅ **Strict TypeScript** - All code passes `tsc --noEmit`
✅ **Shared types** - Types shared between frontend & backend
✅ **AuthRequest usage** - All controllers use proper types
✅ **Prisma Decimal casting** - Proper handling of Decimal types
✅ **Error handling** - Consistent error types and messages

## Example Usage

### Create Review (Frontend)

```typescript
import { api } from '@/lib/api';

const createReview = async (bookingId: string) => {
  const response = await api.reviews.create({
    bookingId,
    overallRating: 5,
    qualityRating: 5,
    timelinessRating: 5,
    professionalismRating: 5,
    reviewText: 'Amazing service!',
    mediaFiles: ['https://example.com/photo1.jpg'],
  });

  console.log('Review created:', response.data.review);
};
```

### Get Provider Reviews (Frontend)

```typescript
const getReviews = async (providerId: string) => {
  const response = await api.reviews.getByProvider(providerId, {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
  });

  console.log('Average rating:', response.data.averageRating);
  console.log('Rating distribution:', response.data.ratingDistribution);
  console.log('Reviews:', response.data.reviews);
};
```

### Toggle Like (Frontend)

```typescript
const toggleLike = async (targetId: string, targetType: 'provider' | 'service') => {
  const response = await api.likes.toggle({ targetId, targetType });

  console.log('Liked:', response.data.liked);
  console.log('Like count:', response.data.likeCount);
};
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Database

- ✅ Indexed all foreign keys for fast joins
- ✅ Composite unique indexes prevent duplicate likes/helpful marks
- ✅ Separate media table for review photos (flexible, can have many)
- ✅ Denormalized counts (likeCount, helpfulCount) for fast reads

### Performance

- ✅ Pagination on all list endpoints
- ✅ Async rating calculations (don't block response)
- ✅ Transactions for atomic count updates
- ✅ Selective field selection in queries

### Future Enhancements

- Consider Redis caching for review counts
- Add rate limiting on like/helpful endpoints
- Implement review moderation workflow
- Add review sorting options (recent, helpful, rating)
- Support review edits history
- Add notification system for new reviews/responses

## Verification

### TypeScript Compilation

✅ Backend: `npx tsc --noEmit` - 0 errors
✅ Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit` - 0 errors (2 unrelated warnings)
✅ Shared Types: Properly exported and imported

### Database

✅ Migration applied successfully
✅ Prisma client regenerated with new models
✅ All relations properly configured

### Code Quality

✅ No `any` types used
✅ All controllers use `AuthRequest`
✅ Proper error handling with `AppError`
✅ Consistent code style and formatting

## Conclusion

The review and like system has been successfully implemented with:

- ✅ Complete database schema with optimized indexes
- ✅ Full backend API with services, controllers, and routes
- ✅ Frontend API integration with type-safe calls
- ✅ Comprehensive type definitions shared across stack
- ✅ Security validations and ownership checks
- ✅ Scalable architecture with atomic operations
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation checks passing

The system is production-ready and follows all project standards and best practices defined in the cursor rules.
